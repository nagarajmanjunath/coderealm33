WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that is designed to be compact, efficient, and portable. The Wasm binary format is represented as a sequence of bytes, which can be interpreted by a Wasm runtime to execute code. Here is a high-level overview of how a Wasm binary file looks like:

Header: The first four bytes of a Wasm binary file are a magic number (0x6d736100) that identifies the file as a Wasm binary file. This is followed by a version number (0x01) that specifies the version of the Wasm specification used to generate the file.

Sections: The rest of the Wasm binary file is divided into a series of sections, each of which contains a different type of data. For example, there are sections that define the module's function signatures, memory layout, global variables, and exports.

Instructions: The instructions that make up the module's functions are encoded as a sequence of variable-length codes, each of which corresponds to a specific Wasm instruction. The instructions are encoded in a stack-based format, which means that they operate on a stack of values rather than using explicit registers.

Type section: The type section defines the signatures of the module's functions and their return types.

Function section: The function section associates the function signatures defined in the type section with their implementation code.

Export section: The export section defines the functions and other module elements that are exposed to the outside world and can be accessed by other modules or JavaScript code.

Import section: The import section defines the functions and other module elements that are imported from other modules.

Memory section: The memory section defines the size and initial values of the module's linear memory.

Global section: The global section defines the global variables used by the module.

In summary, the WebAssembly binary format is a compact and efficient representation of a module's functions, memory layout, and other elements. The format is designed to be portable and can be executed by a Wasm runtime on a wide range of platforms, making it a powerful tool for building web applications, serverless functions, and other types of software.
