WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that can be executed in a virtual machine. The WebAssembly runtime is the software that loads and executes Wasm modules in a secure and efficient way.

The Wasm runtime typically consists of several components, including the loader, the compiler, the linker, the validator, and the execution engine. Here is an overview of each of these components:

Loader: The loader is responsible for fetching the Wasm module from the network or file system and preparing it for execution. This involves parsing the binary format, checking the module header, and loading the various sections into memory.

Compiler: The compiler translates the Wasm module into machine code that can be executed by the host system's processor. There are several types of compilers, including ahead-of-time (AOT) compilers that generate machine code before execution, and just-in-time (JIT) compilers that generate machine code on-the-fly during execution.

Linker: The linker is responsible for resolving symbols and references within the Wasm module and linking them to external libraries or system calls. This allows the module to call functions or access resources that are not defined within the module itself.

Validator: The validator checks the Wasm module for compliance with the Wasm specification and ensures that it does not contain any malicious or unsafe code. This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure that the module can be safely executed in a sandboxed environment.

Execution engine: The execution engine is responsible for executing the Wasm module's instructions and managing its runtime environment. This includes allocating memory, managing stack frames, and handling interrupts or exceptions.

In summary, the Wasm runtime is a sophisticated software stack that allows Wasm modules to be loaded, compiled, linked, validated, and executed in a secure and efficient way. By providing a standardized and portable binary format, WebAssembly makes it possible to run code written in multiple languages on a wide range of platforms, from web browsers to server environments.
