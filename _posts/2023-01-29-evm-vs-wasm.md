Language support: EVM supports Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, as well as a few other languages like Viper and Bamboo. WASM, on the other hand, supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Rust, and even high-level languages like JavaScript.

Deployment: EVM smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum network and are stored on the blockchain. WASM applications can be deployed on a web server and served to users via a web browser.

Cost: EVM smart contracts require gas to be executed, which can be expensive, especially for complex or resource-intensive applications. WASM applications run in the browser and do not require any additional costs.

Portability: EVM smart contracts are portable within the Ethereum network, but cannot be easily transferred to other blockchain platforms. WASM applications, on the other hand, can run in any web browser that supports WASM, making them highly portable.

Security: EVM provides a secure environment for executing smart contracts and enforcing rules set by the contract. However, security vulnerabilities in smart contract code can result in significant losses, as seen in several high-profile incidents on the Ethereum network. WASM applications are less secure than EVM contracts, as they can be vulnerable to attacks from malicious actors in the browser environment.

In summary, EVM is well suited for building secure decentralized applications on the Ethereum network, while WASM provides a fast and efficient runtime environment for dapps in the browser. The choice between EVM and WASM will depend on the specific requirements and trade-offs of the dapp.
