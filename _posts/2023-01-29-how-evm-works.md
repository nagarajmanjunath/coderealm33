The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the platform that operates smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It carries out the instructions of contracts on the Ethereum system and takes charge of implementing the rules established by the contract. 

Here is the way the EVM works:
Firstly, contracts are composed in Solidity or another programming language supported by the EVM and are posted to the Ethereum network. After deployment, the code of the contract is stored on the blockchain and can be accessed by anyone. Subsequently, when a contract is triggered, the EVM runs its code.
 
The contract can take in data, access and modify its own storage, and collaborate with other contracts on the Ethereum network. Additionally, for every activity done by the EVM, like running a function or accessing storage, a certain amount of gas is needed, which is an indication of the computational effort to do the action. The cost of gas is paid in Ether.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is an essential element of the Ethereum network, which facilitates the construction and deployment of decentralized applications. 
As the EVM executes the code of a smart contract, it alters the state, which includes the contract's storage, the balance of its related Ethereum account, and any other data connected with the contract. 
Furthermore, the EVM is enacted by all nodes in the Ethereum network, ensuring that all state changes produced by the EVM are properly reflected in the global state of the blockchain. 
This guarantees that all the changes brought by the EVM are valid and irreversible, in line with the consensus regulations of the Ethereum network. Ultimately, the EVM serves as a secure and efficient environment for smart contracts, making it possible for developers to create and deploy applications on the Ethereum network.
